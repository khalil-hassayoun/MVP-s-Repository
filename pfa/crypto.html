          <p><i>A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography and recorded with a distributed public ledger, which serves as the method of transaction verification.</i></p>

            <p><i>The most popular cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple.</i></p>
            
            <p><i>Bitcoin was created by an entity named Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 with the pseudonym P2P Cryptography (which stands for Peer-to-Peer Cryptography).
              Nakamoto wanted to create a way that would allow people to directly exchange money electronically without the need for a third party (such as a bank). Nakamoto never revealed his true identity and has remained anonymous since 2009.</i></p>
            
            <p><i>By October 2017, the total value of all existing bitcoins exceeded $100 billion US dollars, with millions of users using cryptocurrency wallets.
              Arguably, there is no necessity as to why cryptocurrencies are valid.</i></p>


            
            <p><i>Cryptocurrencies can be used to transfer assets in a secure, anonymous and very fast way.</i></p>


            
            <p><i>The drawbacks of cryptocurrencies are similar to that of the early days of the Internet when people were using it for purchasing things from different services with their credit cards and there was nothing specific that could prevent a fraudster from stealing everything from your card usage history or even putting up an fake website and claiming that you have paid for goods and services when you didn't.
              When an individual lives in an area where a cryptocurrency is accepted as a form of payment from local businesses, it becomes easier for that person to use it in everyday life.</i></p>


            
            <p><i>This is called "Going Crypto" or "Going Cashless".</i></p>


            
           <p><i>At the moment, cryptocurrencies are starting to become more mainstream and are quickly becoming more popular with people who have no prior knowledge of what cryptocurrency really is.
            There are two ways for cryptocurrency to become globally used.</i></p>
